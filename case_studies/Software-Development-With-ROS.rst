Development of a ROS2 component
===============================

When you are developing a ROS2 system usually you will first check if
the ROS2 ecosystem does not provide all components that you need for your
system. If components are missing, you need to develop the component on your
own. In this case study we will take a look into the steps necessary for
such a development.

Planning & Design
-----------------
Before starting with the development of your ROS2 package, you need to plan
a few things. Most importantly, you should already decide whether your
package will be open sourced and if so which **open source license** to use for your package. 
Also if you want to integrate your ROS2 package into a ROS Distro you
need to think about how you want to maintain the package and what kind of
quality level your package should have. **ROS2 package quality levels** can be
