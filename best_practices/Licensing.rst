Open Source Licensing
=====================
Although the internet has been running for decades on (F)OSS, with Linux
being the primary example, only recently robotics companies have started
to embrace (F)OSS. The fast access to state-of-the-art algorithms and
collaborative (hence cheaper) developments outweigh the
common not-invented-here attitude. Making use of (F)OSS for commercial
robotic systems requires proper assessment of the software licences,
for which we have collected the best practices. A first yet quite complete
overview on licensing issues can be found on dedicated websites [2-4].

Importantly, a common misunderstanding about the “business friendliness”
of open-source software licenses must be corrected [1]. Although some
licenses, such as (L)GPL live up to their difficult reputation that
any new software also must be released as FOSS, this is not true for most
licenses that are used for the recommended frameworks such as ROS. Most
often, ROS packages are released under Apache 2.0, BSD, or MIT licenses 
113] which allow use of the free open-source software inside closed
commercial software products.

Recommendations
---------------
The recommended best practice before commencing agriculture robot product
development is to conduct a thorough licensing trace to ensure that there
are no hidden liabilities. Note that software packages without a license
are more of a liability than those with a license, because the authors
formally still have all the rights, even if they make their source code
publicly available.
