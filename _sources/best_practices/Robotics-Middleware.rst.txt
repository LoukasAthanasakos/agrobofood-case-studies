Open Source Robotics Middleware
===============================

Agricultural robots are complex systems. Typically many different
processes need to run concurrently, such as navigation, perception,
manipulation and process and mission control. Enabling this in a software
system while keeping the software modular and well-structured calls for
a programming framework including middleware.

Currently, there are a number of robot software frameworks and middlewares
available. Most notably:

* ROS/ROS2
* YARP
* ROCK
* OROCOS


Recommendations
---------------
ROS2 is currently the robot middleware that is being developed and driven in
the most professional way (by a consortium of more than 20 organisations).
Therefore we recommend using ROS2 when building a new robot. YARP, OROCOS and ROCK
are also viable solutions, but lack the ecosystem size of ROS/ROS2.
