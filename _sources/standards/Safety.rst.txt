Safety Standards
================

ISO 18497:2018 - Safety of highly automated agricultural machines
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This document gives principles for the design, verification, validation
and provision of information for use of a highly automated agricultural
machine (HAAM). The purpose of this document is to assist in the provision
of safety requirements, means of verification and information for use to
ensure an appropriate level of safety for agricultural and forestry
tractors and self-propelled machines with functions allowing highly
automated operations. It also provides guidance on the type of information
on safe working practices (including information about residual risks)
to be provided by the manufacturer. This document is not applicable to
forestry applications; mobile, semi-mobile or stationary machinery used
for farm yard or barn operations; and operations on public roads including
relevant requirements for braking and steering systems. Risks related to
the communication between agricultural vehicles are also out of scope.


ISO 25119 - Tractors and machinery for agriculture and forestry â€” Safety-related parts of control systems
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISO25119 sets out general principles for the design and development of
safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS) on tractors used in
agriculture and forestry and on self-propelled ride-on machines and
mounted, semi-mounted and trailed machines used in agriculture. It can
also be applied to mobile municipal equipment (e.g. street-sweeping
machines).

It is based on a safety life cycle, which combines the most important
safety-related activities in the concept phase, during series development,
at the start of production (SOP), during operation and maintenance till
decommissioning.

In order to guide the designer during design, verification, and to
facilitate the assessment of the achieved performance level, ISO 25119
defines an approach based on a classification of architecture with different design features and specific behaviour in case of a fault.
The performance levels and categories can be applied to the control
systems of all kinds of mobile machines: from simple systems (e.g.
auxiliary valves) to complex systems (e.g. steer by wire), as well
as to the control systems of protective equipment (e.g. interlocking
devices, pressure sensitive devices).

ISO 3691-4:2020 Industrial trucks - Safety requirements and verification
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISO 3691-4:2020 outlines information about the safety of industrial trucks. 
Even though the standard is not applicable to all agrifood robots, it gives
some interesting details about designing autonomous industrial trucks for
industrial applications.

Especially interesting for many agrifood robotics applications are the
parts about contactless protection equipment and velocity control. The
design principles set in this standard can be applied to for many indoor
applications in the agrifood sector.

ISO 10218 Robots and robotic devices
------------------------------------
ISO 10218 outlines information about the safety for industrial robots. Even
though the standard is not applicable to all agrifood robots, it can be of
interest when a mobile manipuator is developed or industrial manipulators
are used in an agrifood application.

Part 1 of the standard describes safety requirements for robots themselves
without being integrated into a bigger assembly. Part 2 contains
information about system integration requirements.
