Robot Modularity Standards
==========================

ISO 22166 - Modularity for service robots
-----------------------------------------
First part of a series of standards aiming to enhance reuse of hardware and software modules to efficiently and safely build application-specific robot solution in various application domains, excluding factory automation. Part one defines general requirements for build modular robot systems. It specifies guidelines for robot system designers / makers as well as suppliers of modules used to build robot systems. These guidelines aim at interoperability of modules from diverse manufacturers, including ensuring safe and secure operation of modules in contexts not precisely known when making the modules. The standard is not a safety standard in its own right, but gives
guidance on how to employ other robotic and machinery safety standards in the context of modular robotics.The standard is currently under development and expected to be published in late 2020.
